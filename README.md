## How to Run the Project

### Development

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Vite development server with hot module replacement (HMR) enabled.

### Build

To create a production build of your application, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `dist` directory.

### Production

To preview the production build, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

This will start a server that serves your production build from the `dist` directory.
